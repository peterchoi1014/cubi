# Headless cubi

Use headless mode when cubi is part of a script or pipeline.

- Inline prompt: `cubi -p "summarize this repo"` or `cubi --prompt "..."`.
- Piped prompt: `git diff | cubi -p "summarize"` keeps the diff on stdin for shell composition; without `-p`, cubi reads piped stdin as the prompt: `printf 'hello' | cubi`.
- System prompt: `cubi --system ./system.txt -p "review"` prepends file contents as instructions.
- JSON events: `cubi --json --no-stream -p "run tests"` emits line-delimited `token`, `tool_call`, `tool_result`, `tool_timeout`, `compacted`, `budget_error`, `consensus_start`, `consensus_subagent_result`, `consensus_decision`, `error`, and `done` events.
- Streaming: one-shot mode buffers by default for predictable scripts; add `--stream` for live tokens.

## `cubi exec` shorthand

`cubi exec <prompt words>` is the script-friendly entry point. It joins
the remaining argv with single spaces and runs the same code path as
`-p "<joined>" --json --no-stream --no-banner`, so each invocation emits
one JSON event per line and exits when the model is done.

```sh
cubi exec list the riskiest files in HEAD | jq -c .
cubi --system ./tone.txt exec rewrite this paragraph more concisely
```

Flags meant to influence the run (e.g. `--system`, `--model`) must
appear *before* `exec`; everything after `exec` is treated as prompt
text.

Exit codes: `0` ok, `2` usage/config, `10` model/API, `11` tool failure, `12` context-window budget exceeded, `13` network (connect refused / DNS / TLS), `130` cancelled.

## Error events

The `error` JSON event carries a `message` plus optional `kind`, `exit_code`,
and `hint` fields.

```json
{"type":"error","message":"could not connect to localhost:11434","kind":"connect_refused","exit_code":13,"hint":"is `ollama serve` running on localhost:11434?"}
```

Known `kind` values: `config`, `auth`, `quota`, `rate_limited`,
`connect_refused`, `dns`, `tls`, `timeout`, `server_error`,
`bad_request`, `cancelled`, `tool`, `budget`, `other`. The set may
grow; consumers should treat unknown values as `other`.

Set `--debug` (or `CUBI_DEBUG=1`, or any non-empty `RUST_BACKTRACE`)
to also print the full anyhow cause chain to stderr in non-JSON mode.

## Quiet output

Headless / JSON mode automatically suppresses every decorative element:
the startup banner, the tool spinner, slash-command edits via `/edit`,
and color codes (when piped or with `NO_COLOR`). Three orthogonal env
knobs let interactive users disable the same affordances individually:

- `CUBI_NO_BANNER=1` — skip the one-line startup banner.
- `CUBI_NO_SPINNER=1` — disable the elapsed-time spinner around tool
  calls. Also honored by `NO_COLOR` and `CUBI_NO_COLOR`.
- `CUBI_EDITOR=…` — pin the editor `/edit` opens (otherwise falls back
  through `$VISUAL`, `$EDITOR`, and the platform default).
- `CUBI_NUM_CTX=…` — raise the Ollama runtime context cap (`num_ctx`).
  cubi derives `num_ctx` from the model's known window, clamped to a safe
  default; a positive override raises that ceiling (still bounded by the
  model's real window).
- `CUBI_READ_FILE_MAX_LINES=…` / `CUBI_READ_FILE_MAX_BYTES=…` — tune the
  cap applied to unbounded `read_file` calls (defaults 400 lines / 50 KiB).
  Raise for large-context models; lower for small-context ones. Ranged
  reads (`start_line`/`end_line`) are never capped.

Examples:

```sh
git diff | cubi -p "summarize the risky changes"
cubi --json --no-stream -p "list the failing checks" | jq -c .
cat release-notes.md | cubi --system tone.txt
```

## Structured event tap (`--events <path>`)

`--events <path>` (or `CUBI_EVENTS=…`) opens the path in append+create
mode and writes one JSON line per internal event. The shape is a strict
superset of `--trace-tools` — it captures full turn lifecycles plus tool
rationales and MCP transitions in addition to tool start/complete. If
the path can't be opened, cubi prints one warning (suppressed in JSON
mode) and continues without the tap rather than aborting the run.

Event types currently emitted:

- `turn_start` — `{type, ts, turn, model}` at the top of each agent turn.
- `tool_call_start` — `{type, ts, tool, args}` with secrets redacted
  through the same `redact_secrets` helper as `--trace-tools` and
  `--print-config`.
- `tool_rationale` — `{type, ts, tool, rationale}` when
  `--explain-tools` (or `CUBI_EXPLAIN_TOOLS=1`) is set; rationale is the
  assistant message that accompanied the tool call, falling back to the
  MCP manifest description, then to `(no description)`.
- `tool_call_complete` — `{type, ts, tool, ok, result_chars}`.
- `mcp_status_change` — `{type, ts, before, after}` where each side is
  `{ok, failed, not_loaded}`. Emitted when the agent loop detects an
  MCP server transition during a turn.
- `turn_end` — `{type, ts, usage, model}`. `usage` carries
  `{prompt_tokens, completion_tokens, elapsed_ms}`.
- `consensus_start` — `{type, ts, goal, models, strategy,
  max_steps_per_subagent}`. Emitted
  before any subagent dispatches when the `consensus_run` meta-tool
  (or the `/consensus` slash command) starts a run. `strategy` is one
  of `vote`, `best-of-n`, `judge`.
- `consensus_subagent_result` — `{type, ts, model, ok, steps_used,
  tool_calls, elapsed_ms, prompt_tokens, completion_tokens, error?}`. One
  event per subagent. `tool_calls` is `0` for LLM-only subagents; tool-enabled
  subagents report their observed tool-call count, with isolated mode using
  the child subprocess JSONL count. `error` is present and non-null only when
  `ok` is false.
- `consensus_decision` — `{type, ts, winner_model, decision_reason}`
  after arbitration completes. `decision_reason` is free-form text
  (e.g. "majority vote 2/3", "judge `qwen3:8b` picked `devstral`: …",
  "best-of-n: `devstral` scored 9 (judge `…`)").

Tool-enabled `consensus_run` is sequential unless called with both
`use_tools: true` and `isolate: true`. Isolated mode launches each
subagent as a headless `cubi --json --no-stream --quiet` subprocess in
its own throwaway git worktree, so the same JSON event stream is parsed
without leaking losing candidates' file edits into the caller's checkout.
Before launching those subprocesses, the parent applies a preflight trust and
plan-mode gate: the parent cwd must be a trusted project and `/plan` must be
off. The parent also resolves the repo
top-level plus the relative cwd and starts each child in the matching
worktree subdirectory. Because children branch from `HEAD`, isolated mode
requires a clean git status (commit, stash, or discard changes first) rather
than trying to copy uncommitted or untracked state into every worktree.
The parent also sets `CUBI_HOME` for each child so Cubi state
(`.cubi/config.json`, trust store, sessions, MCP config, etc.) is rooted in
the child temp home rather than the real user profile.
Use `max_steps` and `isolated_time_cap_secs` on the meta-tool
(or `/consensus ... --isolate --max-steps <n>
--isolated-time-cap-secs <seconds> ...`) to set each subagent's step budget
and isolated subprocess wall-clock cap; timeouts are reported as
per-subagent errors instead of aborting the whole consensus run.

`--trace-tools <path>` still produces its original `tool_start` /
`tool_complete` record shape for back-compat, but new integrations
should prefer `--events`; the same redaction rules apply.

## Tamper-evident receipts (`--receipts <path>`)

`--receipts <path>` (or `CUBI_RECEIPTS=…`, or `receipts` in
`~/.cubi/config.json`; precedence is flag > env > config) opens a
hash-chained JSONL audit log. Every session, user message, tool call,
tool result, assistant message, and session end produces one append-only
entry whose `this_hash` covers `prev_hash` plus the canonical
serialization of the rest of the record. Full args/results live in
`<path>.payloads/<sha256>.json` so the receipts file itself stays small
and grep-able.

If `cubi keys init` has been run, every subsequent entry is signed with
the Ed25519 key under `~/.cubi/keys/`. Verify a log (and optionally its
signatures) with:

```sh
cubi verify-receipts /path/to/r.jsonl                         # chain + payloads
cubi verify-receipts /path/to/r.jsonl --pub-key ~/.cubi/keys/ed25519.pub
cubi verify-receipts /path/to/r.jsonl --no-verify-payloads --json
```

Exit codes: `0` ok, `2` tamper detected (chain break, payload mismatch,
or signature mismatch — the offending `seq` is reported on stderr), `13`
I/O error. Receipts are a side-channel: when the file can't be written
mid-session, cubi degrades to a single `tracing::warn!`, disables the
writer for the rest of the process, and the session continues. See
`DEVELOPMENT.md` § "Receipts format" for the on-disk shape and
canonical-serialization algorithm.

> ⚠️ **Security note.** Unlike `--events`/`--trace-tools`, which run
> tool arguments and results through `redact_secrets` before
> emitting, the payload sidecars under `<path>.payloads/` store the
> **raw** tool args and results — including any API keys, tokens, file
> contents, or other secrets the session touches. Treat the receipts
> file and its `*.payloads/` directory as **sensitive**:
>
> - Keep them on a private filesystem with restrictive permissions
>   (`chmod 600` / a user-only directory).
> - Add the receipts path and `*.payloads/` to `.gitignore` (and to
>   any container image / CI artifact exclusion lists) so they are
>   never committed or uploaded.
> - Rotate or scrub them before sharing a session log with anyone
>   else.
